# On Demand Liquidity (Distributed) Exchange

With code derived from and thanks to the World Exchange project the ODL EXCHANGE is implemented at www.odl.exchange 

ODL Exchange is a 100% HTML client-side-only site implementing much of Ripple XRP's ODL capabilities through the Ripplenet API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols, including Ripple's KYC features like allowing only authorized token holders.
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask orderbooks for any symbol with autobridging implemented to connect all XRP-traded symbols.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers), including the ability to both generate and verify valid wallets/addresses completely offline by saving the webpage to your desktop.

- Bonus: Chat box feature running entirely on Ripple, decentralized and stored forever, doubles as a free notary because nothing can ever be changed or removed once it's up.

- Bonus 2: Ripple Names is back and re-implemented entirely on the ledger.

This project and www.odl.exchange site simply makes calls into the functionality of Ripple's blockchain network where the underlying blockchain here has built-in exchange issuance, trading, and compliance functionality.

www.odl.exchange is a functional working and useable example for much of Ripple's API functionality and the Source Code can be openly inspected
